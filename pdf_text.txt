About Me
Hi, I'm Pei Pei! I'm an empathetic, creative, and passionate product designer with a background in UI/UX design and marketing. My journey has been shaped by my desire to learn, grow, and connect with 
people from different backgrounds. I value authenticity, inclusivity, and kindness—believing that everyone is doing their best in life, and the best thing we can do is support one another.
One thing that makes my story unique is how I got here. I won the U.S. Green Card Lottery, which gave me the opportunity to live in America, explore new cultures, learn a new language, and build a career 
that I love. The experience has been both rewarding and challenging, but it has shaped me into who I am today. My friends and family describe me as creative, a good listener, and someone who is always 
eager to help others.

What Drives Me?
I’ve always been drawn to creativity and problem-solving. While I’m passionate about product design, my long-term aspiration is to build my own business. I love learning from others—whether it's about their 
ideas, expertise, or unique perspectives. I believe that everyone has something valuable to bring to the table, and that’s what makes collaboration so powerful.
For now, I’m focused on refining my skills in product design, enhancing user experiences, and contributing to projects that make an impact.
